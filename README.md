## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Piyush, and this is where I document my journey into the fascinating worlds of robotics, automation, embedded systems, and artificial intelligence.
---

I'm proficient in Python, Arduino, Web Development, Electronics, CAD Design, and Generative AI, providing a versatile toolkit for my diverse creations. Additionally, I have a strong passion for physics and mathematics. I find immense joy in hands-on creation, from Arduino projects and coding to continuous learning.

I've independently designed, developed, and implemented several hardware and software projects. My approach emphasizes creative problem-solving, building unique solutions, and resourcefulness.

## My Key Projects:

**1. AI-Powered Computer Control System:**
 - Engineered and developed from scratch, an innovative AI agent capable of autonomously controlling a computer and interacting with its UI.
 - Designed the full-stack solution, including a web app UI (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), a Python backend (Flask, PyAutoGUI, OpenCV), and custom algorithms. Leveraged Google Gemini API for AI model.
 - [View on GitHub](https://github.com/piyush-suteri/Autonomous-AI-Agent)

**2. CNC Drawing Machine:**
 - Constructed a fully functional CNC Drawing Machine, innovatively designed from discarded wood and unipolar stepper motors, significantly reducing costs without compromise on quality.
 - The project involved comprehensive design (FreeCAD), assembly, and content creation, including a detailed construction video and an Instructable.
 - [View on Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-CNC-Drawing-Machine-With-Arduino-and-28byj-48-/)

**3. Automation & Robotics:**
 â€¢ Developed multiple robotics platforms, including obstacle avoidance, line and object-following, and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi controlled robots (utilizing ESP8266 NodeMCU).
 â€¢ Built an Arduino-based Home Automation system for remote control of devices.

Beyond engineering, I explore physics and mathematics with a rigorous and analytical approach, applying first-principles thinking to understand concepts deeply. (You can find examples of my work in my **Academic Articles** repository.)
